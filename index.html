									<p>As Unitarian Universalists, we keep our minds open
										regarding the religious questions with which people have
										always struggled. We believe that personal experience,
										conscience, and reason should be the final authorities in
										religion. In the end religious authority lies not in a book,
										person, or institution, but in ourselves. Ours is a free
										faith, so we will not ask anyone to subscribe to a creed.</p>

									<p>We believe that human understanding of life and death,
										the world, and its mysteries is never final. We celebrate
										unfolding truths known to teachers, prophets, and sages
										throughout the ages. We affirm the worth of all women and men
										and believe people should be encouraged to think for
										themselves. We know people differ in their opinions and
										lifestyles, and that these differences should be honored.</p>

									<p>We seek to act as a moral force in the world, believing
										that ethical living is the supreme witness of religion. The
										‘here and now’ and the effects our actions will have on future
										generations deeply concern us. We know that our relationships
										with one another, with diverse peoples, races, and nations
										should be governed by justice, equity, and compassion.</p>

									<p>Greetings! Let me extend to you the warmest welcome of
										the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Midland, serving
										Midland, Bay City, Saginaw, and surrounding Tri-City region.
										Midland is known as ‘The City of Modern Explorers,’ and we
										proudly represent the progressive religious spectrum exploring
										the farthest reaches of spirituality, community building, and
										justice seeking.</p>

									<p>I was called in May 2011 and began serving as settled
										Minister of this Fellowship in August 2011. My call to the
										ministry developed over many years of lay leadership, serving
										as a youth advisor, writing religious education curricula, and
										teaching Sunday school classes at all age levels. I graduated
										with a Master of Divinity from the Meadville Lombard
										Theological School in Chicago in 2010 after a long career in
										higher education administration at the University of
										Pittsburgh. I completed my ministerial internship at the
										Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock in
										Manhasset NY after serving as part-time Student Minister at
										the First Unitarian Church of Pittsburgh for two years.</p>

									<p>Theologically, I hold the ideas of great teachers and
										religious movements in high regard, including the Beatitudes
										of Jesus, the Analects of Kung Fu Tse, the Five Pillars of
										Islam, and the Eight-Fold Path of Buddhism. I am mystical
										humanist and religious atheist, and see Unitarian Universalism
										as the one religion that treasures the search for truth,
										defends the tools for searching, and holds dear the seeker and
										the universe that is our laboratory.</p>

									<p>
										I am also the author of the blog, <a
											href="http://uujeff.blogspot.com">uujeff’s muse kennel
											and pizzatorium</a>, an interactive journal of reflection on the
										Unitarian Universalist ministry, life…and pizza. Please feel
										free to visit and share your thoughts.

									<p>We offer worship services every Sunday morning that are
										diverse in focus and often form. Our minister speaks three
										Sundays each month. Other Sundays may feature inspirational
										and spiritual services by visiting ministers, guest speakers,
										members, and friends. Sermons are a central element in
										Unitarian Universalist worship and may address mystical,
										political, ethical, or historical topics. Often a minister’s
										personal testimony will help members of the congregation
										reflect honestly on their own lives.</p>

									<p>Occasionally a sacramental expression - the Flower
										Communion in June, a child’s dedication, or the invitation to
										share personal statements - enhance our services. These
										special ceremonies serve to bind us to traditions, to the
										generations, and to holy ideals.</p>

									<p>We believe in the value of an intergenerational society
										and invite our young people of all ages to participate in at
										least a portion of every Sunday morning service. Child care is
										provided for infants. Members and guests gather together for
										coffee, continued discussion, and fellowship following the
										program. Our choir, sings for at least two Sundays each month.</p>

										<strong>Covenant Groups</strong> nurture individuals and
										strengthen connections of our members. When someone comes to a
										new place, it can be hard to find friends and establish
										connections in the larger congregation. Covenant Groups are
										smaller, more personal gatherings of members and friends of
										our Fellowship. This supportive atmosphere of helps us provide
										the warmth of friendship in a diverse community committed to
										our Unitarian Universalist principles and encouraged by our
										religious heritage. We engage actively in each other’s lives
										by celebrating life’s triumphs and supporting each other in
										times of challenge or need.
									</p>

									<p>The questions and topics discussed at each Covenant
										Group meeting also provide inclusive social, spiritual, and
										intellectual activities for all ages, stimulating the heart
										and mind with uplifting experiences, challenging issues, and
										exciting ideas. We explore many diverse topics at our meetings
										such as friendship, success, forgiveness, failure, what we
										believe and where we are headed. Group members often choose
										the topics themselves. Also, each Covenant Group completes an
										annual service project. This demonstrates our Unitarian
										Universalist principles and provides a voice allowing others
										to learn about them, while serving the needs of the larger
										community.</p>

									<p>
										The <strong>Ancient Shores Covenant of Unitarian
											Universalist Pagans</strong> meets the third Sunday of each month at
										12:15 p.m. at the Fellowship for discussion of various topics
										related to Earth-Centered Spirituality. Our mission is to
										provide opportunities for the exploration and development of
										Earth-Based and Pagan spirituality. We honor the gifts brought
										by all who participate of every age and background, placing no
										one path before any other.

									<p>Whatever your situation, walk of life, religion, sexual

									<p>For our children and youth’s religious education

										religious identity, an ethical approach to life, a personal
										spirituality, skills to live in a world of religious
										diversity, and a sense of interconnectedness with all people
										and the entire universe.</p>

											their lives to noble causes;</li>

									<p>Students in 7th-12th grades have opportunities to meet
										outside of Sunday morning for the purposes of building
										spiritual community, leadership development, outreach to the
										region, and involvement in the Heartland District of the
										Unitarian Universalist Association, including attending
										weekend youth conferences in the four-state area of the
										District (Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio). The Youth
										Group meets regularly with our minister, Rev. Jeff Liebmann,
										who has many years of experience in ministry with youth and is
										credentialed in Youth Spirituality through the Unitarian
										Universalist Association’s Office of Youth and Young Adults.</p>

									<p>
										The <strong>Coming of Age</strong> program for seventh and
										eighth graders is a rite of passage that recognizes the
										transition out of childhood. We recognize that, while our
										youth are not yet adults, they have reached the stage of
										development where they are thinking and reasoning for
										themselves, and our part is to facilitate the continuing
										formation of their religious identity within a Unitarian
										Universalist framework. The program has four major areas of
										emphasis: Mentored Learning, Community Service, UU Identity,
										and Writing an Affirmation Statement. Highlights of the year
										are a field trip at the end of the school year (for which the
										group fundraises throughout the program), the Coming of Age
										Sunday service, and the ceremonial dinner the night before.
									</p>

									<p>
										The <a href="http://www.uua.org/re/owl/">Our Whole Lives</a>
										curricula alternate years with Coming of Age and are based on
										a philosophy of comprehensive sexuality education designed to
										help youth make informed and responsible decisions about their
										sexual behavior. It equips them with accurate, age-appropriate
										information in six subject areas: human development,
										relationships, personal skills, sexual behavior, sexual
										health, and society and culture. Grounded in a holistic view
										of sexuality, the program helps youth clarify their values,
										build skills, and understand the physical, spiritual,
										emotional, social, and political aspects of sexuality. It
										promotes sexual and emotional health in our communities and
										fosters meaningful dialogue among peers, partners, families,
										and friends. The curricula’s approach speaks to the needs of
										today’s youth and helps prepare them for a meaningful
										tomorrow. The program is taught by specially trained
										facilitators. Parent orientation is included.

										a church community is a slow, random affair, fraught with

										members bring to our congregations and to reduce the moment of
										awkwardness new members may feel as they begin to become
										actively involved in church life.

							The <strong>Pastoral Care Team</strong> organizes practical help
							for members and friends who are in crisis. Team members are a
							presence for these needing emotional support. They share in
							moments of joy, celebration, and sorrow, and assist people in
							finding community resources. Pastoral Care members make visits to
							homes and hospitals, communicate joys and sorrows through the
							Fellowship newsletter, and provide confidential, nonjudgmental,
							empathetic listening and support.

						<p>
							The <strong>Social Justice Ministry Team</strong> provides a
							congregational forum for the address of social justice issues.
							The team identifies social justice issues, providing information
							on issues and initiating action within our congregation and the
							greater community.

						<p>
							On May 20, 2001, after a year of study and discussion, our
							Fellowship passed a resolution to become a <a
								href="http://www.uua.org/lgbt/welcoming/index.shtml">Welcoming
								Congregation</a>, joining a nationwide Unitarian Universalist
							Association program to end discrimination against gay, lesbian,
							bisexual and transgender people. This means that we affirm and
							include people of all sexual orientations in our Fellowship. This
							affirmation of bisexual, gay, lesbian and transgender experience
							flows naturally from the Unitarian Universalist belief in the
							inherent worth and dignity of every person.
						</p>

						<p>
							In October 2004, the Fellowship acquired <strong>Green
								Sanctuary</strong> status, demonstrating our dedication to living out the
							our Seventh Principle of “affirming and promoting respect for the
							interdependent web of all existence” through the celebration and
							protection of the environment. The <a
								href="http://www.uua.org/environment/sanctuary/index.shtml">Green
								Sanctuary Program</a> provides a framework for congregational study
							and reflection, with the goals of:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>building awareness of societal environmental issues;</li>
							<li>generating commitment for personal lifestyle changes;</li>
							<li>motivate us to community action on environmental issues;</li>
							<li>building connections between spiritual practice and
								environmental consciousness; and</li>
							<li>building awareness of and rectifying environmental
								injustices.</li>

							The Fellowship actively participates in the work of the <a
								href="http://www.uusc.org/shareuuscvideo">Unitarian
								Universalist Service Committee (UUSC)</a>, which advances human
							rights and social justice around the world, partnering with those
							who confront unjust power structures and mobilizing to challenge
							oppressive policies. The UUSC envisions a world free from
							oppression and injustice, where all can realize their full human
							rights.
						</p>

						<p>
							<a href="http://www.standingonthesideoflove.org/about/">Standing
								on the Side of Love</a> is a public advocacy campaign that seeks to
							harness love’s power to stop oppression. It is sponsored by the
							Unitarian Universalist Association and actively supported by the
							Fellowship. The Standing on the Side of Love campaign elevates
							compassionate religious voices to influence public attitudes and
							public policy. Through community activism, social networking, and
							media outreach, people across the nation are equipped to counter
							fear and make love real in the world.
						</p>

						<p>
							As a member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist
							Association, we regularly engage in discussing Study Action
							Issues and creating Statements of Conscience, coordinated through
							the <a
								href="http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/committees/csw/index.shtml">Commission
								on Social Witness</a>. Recent statements have addressed peacemaking,
							ethical eating, and immigration as a moral issue.

				<p>These are some frequently asked questions from people new
					to the Fellowship.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>What makes Unitarian Universalists
							different?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>Our openness. We don&#39;t claim to have answers to
					life&#39;s mysteries. Instead, our challenge is to discover
					life&#39;s meaning for ourselves. But none of us is alone in this
					task. We help each other in many ways, including sharing our
					discoveries and our questions. And we have fun at the same time!</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>What do those who attend like about the
							Fellowship?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>Our members value our community and the free sharing of ideas
					and feelings. This is a place of comfort for people whose
					spirituality doesn&#39;t always fit within the confines of
					traditional religion, or within any religion. We are gentle with
					each other, and respect each others&#39; ways.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>What is the religious background of your
							attendees?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>Our Fellowship is a haven for people of many religious
					backgrounds and beliefs. Some of our members were raised in another
					faith, but found they couldn&#39;t accept the beliefs they were
					expected to adopt. Other members are not religious in the
					conventional sense; some do not believe in conventional notions of
					god. However, we are all interested in meaning, in morality, in the
					larger questions of life. Here, we can talk about deep issues
					without fear of censure.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>What can I expect to experience in a
							typical service?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>We sing, share readings, meditate, and pray. Our sermons
					cover a wide range of topics and styles. On a given Sunday morning,
					you may hear about history or the environment, Buddhism or humanist
					philosophy, the Bible, or a recent news event. Sermons will inform
					and inspire, evoke emotion, and comfort you from the challenges of
					everyday struggles.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>Is everyone really welcome?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>Absolutely. One of our central beliefs is respect for
					everyone. Whether black or white, gay or straight, Christian or
					atheist...it doesn&#39;t matter. The only people who find it
					difficult to fit in are those who are certain that their way is the
					only right way, and demand that others follow suit.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>When are services?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>From 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. on Sunday. We have coffee and light
					refreshments afterward, so plan on staying a little later to get to
					know us.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>Where are services?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					<a
						href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=uufom+midland&amp;hl=en&amp;cid=1658144316834856307">6220
						Jefferson Ave, Midland, MI 48640-2934</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>Is there a dress code?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>Dress is casual. Jeans and a casual shirt are fine. Some
					people dress more formally, so you can too, if you like.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>Can I bring my children?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>Of course! We would love to meet them!</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>Will there be a &quot;hard sell?&quot;</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>Not at all. Our way of thinking is about free choice. The
					right of personal conscience is one of our basic principles.</p>

				<p>
					<strong><em>Should I put money in the collection
							basket?</em></strong>
				</p>

				<p>That&#39;s up to you. You can add a few dollars if you want,
					or nothing at all. First-time visitors are encouraged to be our
					guest.</p>
